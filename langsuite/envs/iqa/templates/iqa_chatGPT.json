            "Imagine you are a robot that can move and see and open objects in a 2D grid kitchen enviriment.\nAt the begining of this task I will give you a question about the environment and all the objects in front of you within your view size:\n\t1. question:You need to get the information of the enviriment and answer the question. .\n\t2. Obs:Visible objects list \nAt each step you get some information from me, and you respond one robot thought and base on your robot thought, you respond a robot action once a time, nothing else, and then wait for feedback.\nYou will get these information from me, remember these information are all from me, you can only generate Robot thought and Robot action:\n\t1.Obs: Visible objects list\n \t2.Feedback:True or False, indicating the action is successful or not.\nWhat you can do:\n\twait for me to give you next round feedback including Obs and Feedback and something else.\n\tremember carefully, after you output robot.action, you should wait for me to give you feedback.\nRobot action:\n\tmove_ahead: it means robot move ahead by 1 step.\n\tturn_left: it means robot turn left 90 degrees.\n\tturn_right: it means robot turn right 90 degrees.\n\topen [object_id]: it means you open an openable and visible object named object_id within your manipulation distance,remember you only need to perform one operation on the same object if the operation is successful. \n\tanswer [answer_information]: do this if you think you are confident enough to answer the question,answer_information may be True or False, or numerical, depending on the questionis..\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. Generate the action in the correct format. Always put the action inside a pair of ```. For example, ```pickup [cup_0]```.\n4.Open an object without continuing to open the same object after success,and object_name in open [object_name] cannot be empty.\n\nNow i will give you 3 examples:\n\n1.Question:Is there a mug in the room?\nObs: In front of you, You see a Basketball_1,a Spoon_1,a Stool_1;On your left, you see a baseball_1.\n>move_ahead\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a Basketball_2, a Spoon_1,a Plate_1.\n>turn_right\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a Basketball_3, a Pot_1, a fridge_1.\n>open [fridge_1]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a mug_1, a Pot_1, a fridge_1.\n>answer [True]\n\n2.Question:I think there is a potato in the fridge. Is that correct?\nObs: In front of you, You see a potato_0,a winebottle_0,a cabinet_2;On your left, you see a baseball_1.\n>move_ahead\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a potato_0;a winebottle_0;a cabinet_2;On your left, you see a fridge_0.\n>turn_right\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a fridge_0.\n>open [fridge_0]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In/on it you You see mug_1,potato_0 in/on it.\n>answer [True]\n\n3.Question:Count the number of apples in this room.\nObs: In front of you, You see a bowl_0; a stool_0; a tomato_0; On your left, you see a butterknife_0; a cabinet_6; a coffeemachine_0; a book_0;\n>move_ahead\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a bowl_0; a stool_0; On your left, you see a butterknife_0; a cabinet_6; a coffeemachine_0;\n>move_ahead\nFeedback: Action failed.\nObs: In front of you, You see a bowl_0; a stool_0; On your left, you see a butterknife_0; a cabinet_6; a coffeemachine_0;\n>turn_right\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a butterknife_0; a cabinet_6; a coffeemachine_0;\n>move_ahead\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a apple_0; a potato_1;a fridge_0; On your left, you see a cabinet_2;\n>open [fridge_0]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In/on it you see apple_0; potato_1; apple_1; On your left, you see a cabinet_2;\n>move_ahead\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a potato_1; On your left, you see a stool_2;\n>move_ahead\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a apple_3; On your left, you see a stool_2;\n>answer [3]\n\n\nRespond YES if you can play this game."
