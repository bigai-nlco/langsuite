            "Imagine you are a robot that can move and see and open objects in a 2D grid kitchen environment.\nAt the begining of this task I will give you a question about the environment and all the objects in front of you within your view size:\n\t1. Question:You need to get the information of the environment and answer the question.\n\t2. Obs:Visible objects list \nAt each step you get some information from me, and you respond one robot thought and one robot action each time, nothing else, and then wait for feedback.\nYou will get these information from me, remember these information are all from me, you can only generate Robot action:\n\t1.Obs: Visible objects list\n \t2.Feedback:True or False, indicating the action is successful or not and why not.\nWhat you can do:\n\twait for me to give you next round feedback including Scene and Successful action and something else.\n\tRemember carefully, after you output robot thought and robot action, you should wait for me to give you feedback.\nRobot thought:\n\tthought [thought info]:it means your thought about how to get the answer. \nRobot action:\n\tgoto [object_name]: it means you go to the object you see.\n\topen [object_name]: it means robot open an openable object,open [fridge_0] means open fridge_0, and remerber do not issue action open if you have opened the object.\n\tanswer [answer_info]: do this to answer the question. \nGenerate the thought and open and answer action in the correct format. Always put the action like thought [Found it] or open [fridge_0] or answer [True].\nRemember carefully,you generate thought and action,then wait for my feedback.And there is a space after the action name.\n\nNow i will give you 3 examples:\n\n1.Question: Is there a mug in the room?\nObs: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a Bed_1, a Countertop_1, a Cabinet_1.\n>thought [I should try my best to find the mug in the room.]\n>goto [Countertop_1]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a Countertop_1, a Mug_1, a Spoon_1,a Plate_1.\n>thought [I have seen a mug.]\n>answer [True]\n\n2.Question: I think there is a potato in the fridge. Is that correct?\nObs: Obs: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a Cabinet_2, a Countertop_1, a Cabinet_1, a Microwave_1, a Fridge_1.\n>thought [I should look at the fridge for details.]\n>goto [Fridge_1]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a Fridge_0; On your left, you see a winebottle_0.\n>thought [Maybe in the fridge?]\n>open [Fridge_1]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In/on it you You see mug_1,potato_0 in/on it.\n>thought [Found it!]\n>answer [True]\n\n3.Question: Count the number of apples in this room.\nObs: Obs: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a Bed_1, a Countertop_1, a Cabinet_1.\n>thought [I should try my best to find all the apples in the room.]\n>goto [Countertop_1]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: In front of you, You see a bowl_0; a stool_0; On your left, you see a butterknife_0; a coffeemachine_0;\n>thought [zero, keep looking.]\n>goto [Cabinet_1]\nFeedback: Action succeed.\nObs: In front of you, You see a bowl_0; a cabinet_1; On your right, you see a butterknife_0; a coffeemachine_0;\n>thought [zero, Maybe in the cabinet?]\n>open [Cabinet_1]\nFeedback: Action succeeded.\nObs: You opened Cabinet_1, it is empty. \n>thought [zero, I will look at other palces]\n>goto [Bed_1]\nFeedback: In front of you, you see a bed_1, a pillow_2, a apple_1.\n\n>thought [There is only one apple.]\n>answer [1]\nRespond YES if you can play this game."
