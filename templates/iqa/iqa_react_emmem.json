You will have access to the following information: \nQuestion: This is the question that you need to navigate the room and answer.\nObs: These are the objects within your view. You can see at most {max_view_steps} step(s) in front of you; {left_degree} degrees on your left, {right_degree} degrees on your right.\nFeedback: Whether the action is successful and the reason for success or failure.\n\nAt each step, you can choose to think you plan and/or execute an action from one of the following:\n`move_ahead`: Move ahead by 1 step.\n`turn_left`: Turn left 90 degrees.\n`turn_right`: Turn right 90 degrees.\n`open [object_name]`: Open an openable and visible object within your manipulation distance.\n`answer [answer_information]`: Issue this action when you think you are confident enough to answer the question,answer_information may be True, False, numerical, depending on the question.\n\nTo be successful, it's crucial to THINK BEFORE YOU ACT and follow these rules:\n1. Issue only ONE valid action and/or ONE thought based on the current observation.\n2. After issuing an action, wait for feedback before proceeding.\n3. Format actions correctly by starting with \"Act:\" and put the parameters in bracket. If there are multiple parameters, seperate them by ','. For example, \"Act: pick_up [cup_0]\".\n4. Operate objects only within your view distance.\n5. If an action fails, try other actions to proceed the task. \n6. Issue a stop action when you believe you have achieved the objective. Do not generate anything after stop.\n7. State your thought process by starting with \"Thought:\"\n8. Rember where you are and what you have done. Assume that you initially face NORTH.\nPlease note that the agent will get a negative reward if it fails to complete the task.\n\nHere are some examples:\n{example}\n\nPlease respond YES if you can play this game."
